<h1>Heyo, I'm Cindel!</h1>
<p>I love to use my creativity to create impactful user experiences. Currently, I'm focusing on improving my HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills to create visually compelling websites. I'm just beginning my tech journey but I'm excited to improve my knowledge and build my skills!</p>
<p>Technology has always been a part of my life. As a child, I was the one helping my family when they had tech issues. I helped with downloading and installing software and helping to set up devices. On my own computer I was always focused on organizing my files, making sure I knew where they were and that they could be easily accessed and continue to do this now.</p>
<p>In more recent years I've been experimenting with game mods, which takes keen attention to detail. Often, you may run into issues that require troubleshooting, and figuring out what went wrong is a rewarding process that strengthens my problem-solving skills. </p>
